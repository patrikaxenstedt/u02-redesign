# Project delta

In this project, we have redesigned the website www.myh.se and used https://minasidor.myh.se/ as inspiration for the color scheme.
You can access the finished project here: http://lackikritsimas.chas.academy/u02-redesign-delta/

* We used Sass to create:
    * a 12-column grid system
    * functions and mixins for consistency
    * a component based structure
        * (most) components are written using BEM
* In order to cooperate efficiently we:
    * used GitHub Projects 
    * created a project handbook which you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HbU-gMG6OomVIkiOyIW7zj_fqYZY0pQ1N_fYhv0lwiU/edit?pli=1#heading=h.2ub3pp6si6rf)
